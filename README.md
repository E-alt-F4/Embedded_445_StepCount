# Embedded_445_StepCount
Step Counting Algorithm developed in Embedded System Design, ENGR445

Walk Detection and Step Counting: Started the project with the excel file used to test the pipeline for filtering and detecting peaks of set data. 

C++ for set data: Translated pipeline into code by creating an algorithm that would detect peaks of accelerometer that I collected knowing the number of total steps walked.
